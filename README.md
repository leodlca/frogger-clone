#Frogger clone
===============================

This project was initiaded as a part of a Nanodegree program.

Some of its contents such as all the images belongs to Udacity.

##How to play

You control a boy who needs to reach the river without being hit by the bugs. 

You can move him by pressing the direction arrow keys of your keyboard, or using WASD.

At first you have 3 lives, everytime a bug hits you, you lose
a life.

The main objective is to get to the river as many times as you
can, if you die, don't worry, your record will be kept.

**But beware, if you refresh the page, quit, or anything like
it, your score will be lost (that's temporary, I'm planning to add a feature to keep track of the scores permanently).**

##How to setup

For now, I'm not hosting this game so you have to either clone
the repository or download it as a zip file, extract it and 
open the index.html file.

##To-do List

- This list is empty for now because I'm busy, but I have plans
- to expand the game
